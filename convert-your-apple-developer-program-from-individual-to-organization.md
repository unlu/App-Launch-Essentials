# Convert your Apple Developer Program from Individual to Organization
If you’ve incorporated your business, then Apple will require you to register as a Corporation to have your app published on the App Store. If you submit your app under an Individual account in your name, it will be rejected.

You must enroll as an organization if your company is a registered company such as Corporation (Corp., Inc.), Limited Liability Company (LLC, LC, Ltd. Co.), or a legal entity (GmbH, AG, KG, oHg, etc.).

If you are a sole proprietorship you must [register as an Individual](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/) . Apple does not accept DBAs, fictitious businesses, trade names, or branches for enrollment as a company/organization

Benefits of an Organization account:
* You can [invite developers to access your account](https://www.mobiloud.com/help/knowledge-base/how-to-invite-users-to-your-apple-developer-account/) 
* You can choose the name that will be displayed on the stores as the Developer of the app – this will match your company name e.g. Business Inc.
* Apple will know you’re authorized to act for the company and will not challenge your use of your own brand name and content
